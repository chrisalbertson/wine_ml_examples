Wine, simple "hello world" examples of Deep Learning using
Keras

I indend to devalope these examples until they are easier 
to read and understand and then incorporate them in a
blog post.
I want to show people how to develope a more complex
applcation of deep learning by the method of staring
with something that is simple, then modifing it
step by step.

This Git repository olds the source code to support the blog
